"BACKGROUND  
This ballot measure addresses the taxation of animal feed held for sale by retailers in Texas. Currently, tangible personal property, like animal feed, is subject to ad valorem taxes, which are taxes based on the assessed value of an item. Retailers argue that this tax burdens them financially and makes it difficult to maintain competitive pricing, especially in agriculture-focused regions. With significant economic activity tied to agriculture in Texas, this measure seeks to relieve retailers from this tax burden, thereby encouraging growth and potential cost savings for consumers. 

BALLOT MEASURE  
The proposed constitutional amendment, H.J.R.A No. A99, would allow the Texas Legislature to create a law exempting animal feed held for retail sale from ad valorem taxation. Essentially, if this amendment passes, animal feed owned by retailers for the purpose of selling at retail would no longer be taxed based on its value. This measure is intended to apply specifically to retailers, potentially lowering operating costs and thereby positively impacting their pricing strategies. The legislature may also establish additional eligibility criteria to ensure the appropriate application of these exemptions. This amendment's implementation is contingent upon voter approval in an election slated for November 4, 2025.

WHAT A YES AND NO VOTE MEANS  
A YES vote means you support amending the Texas Constitution to allow the legislature the power to exempt animal feed for retail sale from being taxed based on its value. This could lead to decreased costs for retailers and possibly lower prices for consumers. A NO vote means you prefer to keep the current tax structure in place, where animal feed held for retail sale continues to be subject to ad valorem taxes based on its value, maintaining the status quo for retailers and tax revenue from these goods.","PRO ARGUMENT 1: H.J.R.A No. A99 will reduce operating costs for retail feed sellers, allowing them to offer more competitive pricing. This benefits local farmers and pet owners, who depend on animal feed, thus strengthening the agricultural sector and local economy.<br><br>COUNTER: The measure could lead to decreased tax revenues, which local governments rely on for funding essential public services, potentially impacting community welfare.<br><br>

PRO ARGUMENT 2: Implementing this tax exemption now supports recovery from economic strains, providing timely relief that encourages expansion and investment in the agricultural supply chain.<br><br>COUNTER: This could set a precedent for further tax breaks, straining financial resources and encouraging more industries to seek exemptions, which could destabilize long-term fiscal health.<br><br>

PRO ARGUMENT 3: Evidence from regions with similar exemptions shows potential for increased market activity and sales, suggesting that this measure could stimulate local economic growth and job creation.<br><br>COUNTER: The economic dynamics in Texas differ, and positive impacts seen elsewhere might not replicate here, particularly if underlying issues like infrastructure and market access are not simultaneously addressed.","CON ARGUMENT 1: The exemption will lead to decreased revenue for local governments, negatively affecting public services like education and infrastructure which rely on tax funding.<br><br>COUNTER: The reduction in tax revenue may be offset by economic growth, as lower costs for feed can reduce prices for consumers, stimulate spending, and ultimately boost local economies and tax generation in other areas.<br><br>

CON ARGUMENT 2: The measure lacks specificity and oversight, potentially opening loopholes for tax avoidance and abuse by large retailers or unrelated commercial entities.<br><br>COUNTER: The legislature can develop stringent eligibility requirements and clear guidelines to target the exemption specifically toward small, independent feed retailers, minimizing potential misuse and ensuring oversight.<br><br>

CON ARGUMENT 3: There is insufficient evidence that the tax exemption will lead to significant cost savings for consumers, as retailers may not pass these savings onto end customers.<br><br>COUNTER: By reducing retailers’ operational costs, market competition should drive businesses to lower prices to attract customers, thereby providing economic benefits to consumers indirectly.","Voter 1 [FOR]: Supporting H.J.R.A No. A99 can lower costs for local farmers and retailers, enabling them to offer more affordable prices for animal feed. This tax exemption can encourage agricultural growth, potentially creating jobs and bolstering the local economy. It also addresses tax equity by removing burdens on essential goods for the community.<br><br>Voter 2 [AGAINST]: You mentioned that this measure benefits local farmers and retailers by lowering costs, but it actually creates an uneven playing field. Granting tax exemptions for animal feed could lead to requests from other sectors for similar treatment, ultimately complicating the tax system and reducing overall tax revenue needed for community services.<br><br>Voter 1 [FOR]: I understand your concern about potential complexity, but addressing essential agricultural sectors is crucial. This measure specifically targets animal feed, which supports local farmers who are vital to the community. The resulting economic benefits and job creation offset potential tax revenue losses, ultimately reinforcing our community's economic resilience.<br><br>Voter 2 [AGAINST]: I see your point about supporting local farmers, but we must consider the long-term fiscal impact. By prioritizing certain goods for tax exemptions, like animal feed, we risk significant budget shortfalls. These funds often support vital community services—education, healthcare—that need consistent revenue, which exemptions would adversely affect.<br><br>Voter 1 [FOR]: I see your concern about potential budget shortfalls, but this exemption specifically helps bolster local agriculture—a key community backbone. With increased profits from reduced tax burdens, farmers and retailers can reinvest in the local economy, ultimately increasing overall tax revenue from other growing sectors and sustaining essential public services.<br><br>Voter 2 [AGAINST]: You argue that increased profits will offset the revenue losses, but there's no guarantee the reinvestment will sufficiently cover the shortfalls. Additionally, relying on indirect benefits can be risky—if the expected economic growth doesn't materialize, we may face a gap in funding for necessary public services, impacting our community.<br><br>Voter 1 [FOR]: I understand your concern about relying on indirect benefits. However, this measure strategically strengthens a critical sector. By exempting taxes on animal feed, we incentivize agricultural expansion, which historically drives sustained economic growth. This proactive approach mitigates financial risks and gradually enhances revenue stability for public services from a stronger economic base.<br><br>Voter 2 [AGAINST]: I get your point about strengthening agriculture, but targeting specific industry sectors for tax breaks sets a risky precedent. It could prompt other sectors to lobby for similar exemptions, overcomplicating tax policy. We risk a fragmented system, making long-term economic planning difficult and potentially undermining essential services and infrastructure funding.",The measure proposes exempting animal feed held for retail sale in Texas from ad valorem taxation.,True,The implementation of the measure is independent of voter approval.,False,A YES vote would allow the Texas Legislature to create a law exempting animal feed from value-based taxes.,True,"If passed, the measure would apply to all tangible personal property, not just animal feed.",False,The measure could potentially result in lower costs for consumers due to reduced retailer expenses.,True
