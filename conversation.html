<tr><td class='voter1'>Supporting H.J.R.A No. A99 can lower costs for local farmers and retailers, enabling them to offer more affordable prices for animal feed. This tax exemption can encourage agricultural growth, potentially creating jobs and bolstering the local economy. It also addresses tax equity by removing burdens on essential goods for the community.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='voter2'>You mentioned that this measure benefits local farmers and retailers by lowering costs, but it actually creates an uneven playing field. Granting tax exemptions for animal feed could lead to requests from other sectors for similar treatment, ultimately complicating the tax system and reducing overall tax revenue needed for community services.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='voter1'>I understand your concern about potential complexity, but addressing essential agricultural sectors is crucial. This measure specifically targets animal feed, which supports local farmers who are vital to the community. The resulting economic benefits and job creation offset potential tax revenue losses, ultimately reinforcing our community's economic resilience.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='voter2'>I see your point about supporting local farmers, but we must consider the long-term fiscal impact. By prioritizing certain goods for tax exemptions, like animal feed, we risk significant budget shortfalls. These funds often support vital community services—education, healthcare—that need consistent revenue, which exemptions would adversely affect.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='voter1'>I see your concern about potential budget shortfalls, but this exemption specifically helps bolster local agriculture—a key community backbone. With increased profits from reduced tax burdens, farmers and retailers can reinvest in the local economy, ultimately increasing overall tax revenue from other growing sectors and sustaining essential public services.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='voter2'>You argue that increased profits will offset the revenue losses, but there's no guarantee the reinvestment will sufficiently cover the shortfalls. Additionally, relying on indirect benefits can be risky—if the expected economic growth doesn't materialize, we may face a gap in funding for necessary public services, impacting our community.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='voter1'>I understand your concern about relying on indirect benefits. However, this measure strategically strengthens a critical sector. By exempting taxes on animal feed, we incentivize agricultural expansion, which historically drives sustained economic growth. This proactive approach mitigates financial risks and gradually enhances revenue stability for public services from a stronger economic base.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='voter2'>I get your point about strengthening agriculture, but targeting specific industry sectors for tax breaks sets a risky precedent. It could prompt other sectors to lobby for similar exemptions, overcomplicating tax policy. We risk a fragmented system, making long-term economic planning difficult and potentially undermining essential services and infrastructure funding.</td></tr>
